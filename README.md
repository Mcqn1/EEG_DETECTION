# EEG Seizure Detection using Machine Learning :

This project provides a complete, end-to-end pipeline to train a machine learning model for seizure detection from EEG data and serve it through a beautiful, interactive web interface built with Streamlit. The system is robustly designed to handle diverse EEG datasets in `.edf` format, automatically standardizing different channel configurations and sampling rates.



## ‚ú® Features

-   **Dynamic Data Handling**: Automatically processes `.edf` files with different channel montages and sampling rates.
-   **Automated Feature Extraction**: Extracts key statistical and frequency-based features from EEG signals.
-   **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Uses `scikit-learn` to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
-   **Interactive Web UI**: A modern, animated dark-themed web interface built with **Streamlit**.
-   **Clean & Organized Code**: A structured project with separate scripts for training and for the web application.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mcqn1/SEIZURE_DETECTION_MODEL.git][(https://github.com/Mcqn1/SEIZURE_DETECTION_MODEL.git)]
    cd SEIZURE_DETECTION_MODEL
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit mne numpy scikit-learn joblib scipy
    ```

3.  **Prepare the Data:**https://github.com/Mcqn1/SEIZURE_DETECTION_MODEL/wiki
    -   Download the required datasets (see Data Acknowledgement section).
    -   Place the patient folders inside the `EEG_DATA` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Train the Model

Before running the web app, you must train the model.

-   **Run the training script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python EEG_TRAIN_MODEL.py
    ```
-   This will create two essential files in the `UTIL_DYNAMIC` folder:
    -   `dynamic_svc_model.pkl`: The trained model.
    -   `common_channels.txt`: The list of channels the model was trained on.

### 2. Run the Web Application

Once the model is trained, launch the web UI.

1.  **Start the Streamlit server:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
    *(If needed, use `python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py`)*

2.  **Open your web browser** to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Analyze a file** by uploading it and clicking the "Analyze" button.
